# Constructor Functions Lab

## Learning Goals

- Build constructor functions
- Build objects with properties from a constructor function

## Intro

Scuber needs you to develop a fast way to create `Scooter`s, `Driver`s, and
`PickupLocation`s as new business keeps rolling in.

## Instructions

Create a constructor function for each of the following:

- Scooter with `year`, `color`, and `model` properties
- Driver with `name`, `age`, and `experience` properties
- PickupLocation with `address` and `city` properties

Make sure you run the tests to make sure your solutions work as expected.
