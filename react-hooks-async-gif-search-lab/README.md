# Async Giphy Search Lab

## Instructions

You're going to be building out a Gif search using the Giphy API. In this lab,
there are no tests to pass. Rather, your task is to create a working app in your
browser using the instructions below. When finished, you should have an
application that can take in a user's input, fetch JSON data from the Giphy API,
and display the results.

## Getting Started

The URL for the API is

`https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=YOUR QUERY HERE&api_key=dc6zaTOxFJmzC&rating=g`

While the above API key _may_ work, we recommend creating your own API key by
following the [instructions on Giphy's developer site][create_key]. Creating a
key is free and only requires an account. Using your own key will prevent any
potential rate limiting if other students are also working on this lesson.

[create_key]: https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/#quick-start-guide

Once you've got your key, you should be able to access the Giphy API from a
browser and receive a JSON response to confirm everything is working.

You should get back an array of objects, each containing information about a
particular image.

```js
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "gif",
      "id": "l0HlNQ03J5JxX6lva",
      "slug": "bbc-wildlife-l0HlNQ03J5JxX6lva",
      "url": "https://giphy.com/gifs/bbc-wildlife-l0HlNQ03J5JxX6lva",
      "bitly_gif_url": "https://gph.is/2iC32M8",
      "bitly_url": "https://gph.is/2iC32M8",

      ...

      "images": {
        "fixed_height_still": {
          "url": "https://media0.giphy.com/media/l0HlNQ03J5JxX6lva/200_s.gif?cid=e1bb72ff5b9fa2866168584b51f13892",
          "width": "400",
          "height": "200",
          "size": "55556"
        },
        ...
        "original": {
          "url": "https://media0.giphy.com/media/l0HlNQ03J5JxX6lva/giphy.gif?cid=e1bb72ff5b9fa2866168584b51f13892",
          "width": "480",
          "height": "240",
        }
        ...
      }
    }
    ]
```

**Note:** Notice there are many URL keys on each image object. The first `url`
key, just below `type`, `id`, and `slug`, will bring you to the images page on
[giphy.com](https://giphy.com/). We only want the path to the actual image,
which is found at `images.original.url`. Using other `url` keys may cause CORS
issues.

## Your Components

### App

Your top level component will be the `App` component - no surprises there!
It will be responsible for rendering the `NavBar` component (this component
is already provided for you, note the project has bootstrap loaded in) and the
`GifListContainer` component.

### GifListContainer

`GifListContainer` should be a component that does data fetching and then
renders its corresponding sub-component. Thatâ€™s it.

In our app, the `GifListContainer` will be responsible for fetching the data
from the Giphy API, storing the first 3 gifs from the response in its component
**state**, and passing that data down to its child, the `GifList` component,
as a prop.

It will also render a `GifSearch` component that renders the form.
`GifListContainer` should pass down a submit handler function to
`GifSearch` as a prop.

### GifList

`GifList` receives data from its props and renders html given the input
data. It can render a top level `<ul>` with each gif as an `<li>`.

### GifSearch

The `GifSearch` component will render a form that receives the user input
for the Giphy search. The text input should be a _controlled component_ that
stores the value of the input in its component state and renders the DOM
accordingly. The React component is always in charge of what the DOM looks like.

`GifSearch` should receive a callback prop from its parent. On a submit
event, it should invoke that callback prop with the value of the text input. It
is this callback function, defined in `GifListContainer`, that will actually
query the API with the text the user has entered.
