# Super Lab

## Learning Goals

- Practice using `super` to extend child class functionality

## Introduction

In this lab we're going to practice the two most common usages of the `super`
keyword.

## Instructions

Define a `Tree` class that will act as our parent:

- A `Tree` instance should take in one parameter when created, `species`, and
  assign this to a property named `species`.
- A `Tree` should have a static method, `definition()`, that returns a short
  definition of all trees:

```txt
A tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves.
```

Define a `Deciduous` class that extends `Tree`:

- A `Deciduous` instance takes two parameters, `species` and `name`. Use
  `super()` in the constructor to use the parent class constructor to assign
  `species`. After `super()`, assign the `name` parameter to the a `name`
  property in the `Deciduous` constructor
- Create a static method, `definition()`, that uses `super` to access
  `definition()` from `Tree` and add the following to the provide a specific
  definition for `Deciduous`:

```txt
Deciduous trees shed their leaves annually.
```

Define a `Evergreen` class that extends `Tree`:

- An `Evergreen` instance takes two parameters, `species` and `name`. Use
  `super()` in the constructor to use the parent class constructor to assign
  `species`, then assign `name` to a property in the `Evergreen` constructor
- Create a static method, `definition()`, that uses `super` to access
  `definition()` from `Tree` and add the following to the provide a specific
  definition for `Evergreen`:

```txt
Evergreens keep their leaves all year round.
```
